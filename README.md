# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey
## Introduction
The intent of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patientsâ€™ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care". In this analysis, I analyzed the results of the survey over the 9 years it took place (2014-2022) to understand the health care issues and trends and provided recommendations to hospitals nationwide on how to improve the patient experience.
