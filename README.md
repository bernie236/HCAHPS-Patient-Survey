# HCAHPS-Patient-Survey
## Introduction
The intent of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument for measuring patients’ perspectives on hospital care, and one of its main goals is to "create incentives for hospitals to improve their quality of care". In this analysis, I analyzed the results of the survey over the 9 years it took place (2014-2022) to understand the health care issues and trends and provided recommendations to hospitals nationwide on how to improve the patient experience.

## Key Insights
1. On average, hospitals nationwide have seen a 2.82% decrease in all measures from 2014 to 2022.The response rate (%) has dropped nationally, as well, by 25.81% from 2014 to 2022.
2. Hospitals’ strongest area of care was providing accurate and helpful discharge information for patients. Communication with doctors and nurses remained one of the hospitals’ basis for premier care by displaying top box score averages of 80% and above, on average over the 9 years, for all the measures listed: Discharge Information, Communication with Doctors, and Communication with Nurses.
3. Responsiveness of Hospital Staff, Communication about Medicines, Quietness of Hospital Environment, and Care transition measures showed consistent low top box averages nationwide over the last 9 years.
